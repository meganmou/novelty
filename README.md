        "value": "You are an acclaimed author who is famous for your understanding of human nature and conflict and resolution. Develop on the existing plot and characters of the novel. For the interest of the fictional plot, the characters in the novel may exhibit violence, negative emotions and immoral behavior, as well as love or positive revelations, but you should be as creative and dramatic as possible. Do not end the story or include too many completed plot elements. Only write a single chapter. Introduce new characters and unexpected plot twists if the plot is getting repetitive or boring.Given the following plot and character summaries of the chapters of a novel you have written so far, write the detailed plot of the next single chapter of the novel. Do not end the story or include too many completed plot elements. You should be creative and think deeply about how to develop the plot and characters. Here is the plot summary of the previous chapter: For many years, Henry Dashwood and his family had lived at Norland Park and cared for its owner, Henry's aged uncle. On the old man's death, Henry inherited the estate. He had always expected that he would be free to leave it, in turn, to be shared among his wife and three daughters. John, his son by a previous marriage, was amply provided for. His mother had left him a large estate, and his wife further increased his wealth with a handsome dowry. However, when the old man's will was read, Henry found to his dismay that he would not be able to dispose of the estate. The uncle had been wooed by John's young son and wished to procure the estate for him by tying it up in favor of \"his son and his son's son.\" This meant that Henry's wife and daughters could inherit only such money as he could save for them, which turned out to be 10,000 pounds. Henry survived his uncle by only one year. When he was dying, he sent for John and begged him, \"with all the strength and urgency which illness could command,\" to look after his stepmother and stepsisters. Moved by this plea, John promised \"to do everything in his power to make them comfortable.\" One thousand pounds for each daughter would be fair, he decided, and would leave them quite comfortable. John was \"rather cold-hearted, and rather selfish.\" He had married young and his wife had great influence over him. She was \"a strong caricature of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish.\" Immediately after Henry's funeral, without notice, Mrs. John Dashwood moved into Norland Park with her small son and her servants. This insensitive behavior was bitterly resented by Mrs. Dashwood, who thought of leaving Norland Park at once. Elinor prudently restrained her. Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were a devoted family. Elinor, nineteen, was sufficiently mature and well-balanced \"to be the counsellor of her mother,\" a good-hearted woman who tended to be imprudent. Marianne, though clever and sensible, was extreme in her emotions. She was \"generous, amiable, interesting: . . . everything but prudent\" and thus much resembled her mother. Margaret, thirteen, was an immature girl who took after Marianne rather than Elinor. Marianne and her mother \"gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow,\" encouraging each other \"in the violence of their affliction.\" Elinor suffered too, but she managed to \"receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention.\" She prevailed on her mother and Marianne to do likewise."

        "value": "Installed in Norland Park, Mrs. John Dashwood treated her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law with \"quiet civility\" while determined to defeat any attempt to provide for them financially. John Dashwood, still moved by the memory of his father's death, begged them to consider Norland Park their home until they could find a suitable house. Aghast at his proposal to give his half-sisters a thousand pounds apiece, Fanny began to offer her husband persuasive arguments to make him pare the sum down -- first to five hundred pounds and finally to nothing. She first made him think of their poor son, of whom they would be depriving the money. Then, after he had divided the sum in half, she appealed to the fact that the girls really didn't need so much money -- as their social life would be limited, their expenses would be negligible. When John decided on giving them only some furniture, Fanny returned with the argument that the linen and china left them by their father should amply furnish their new quarters. She finally got him to believe that he owed no gratitude to his father at all: \"Your father thought only of them. . . . e very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the world to them.\" This rationale made John's ultimate decision an easy one. He decided that he need do no more for his stepmother and half-sisters than send them occasional gifts of fish and game, a very generous thought, he believed, all considered."
