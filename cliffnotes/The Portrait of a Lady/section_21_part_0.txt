He learns that Osmond has forbidden Pansy to associate or dance with him. Isabel has to send him away when she sees Pansy coming. Lord Warburton comes to Isabel and prefers to talk with her rather than to dance. She reminds him that some ten days ago he had said that he wanted to marry Pansy. She asks why he has done nothing. Lord Warburton responds that he wrote Osmond a letter this very morning, he has not sent it but will do so tomorrow. When Lord Warburton sees Rosier, he wonders about him. Isabel reveals Rosier's intentions and that Osmond objects because Rosier is not important enough and does not have enough money. Isabel tacitly conveys to Lord Warburton that Pansy is in love with Mr. Rosier and that perhaps the best thing for Lord Warburton to do would be to let Pansy alone. She also realizes that Lord Warburton is not in love with Pansy. Thus later, she is able to tell Rosier that she is helping his cause.", "analysis": "Apparently Isabel is not trying to induce Lord Warburton to marry Pansy. Her motives, however, are the best. She knows that Such a marriage would please no one except Osmond and, moreover, she knows that it would make Pansy and Rosier very unhappy. The intrinsic happiness of Pansy is more important than the displeasure of Osmond. In the light of Isabel's actions here, we must note that she has finally decided to interfere. And her influence will be important."}
